<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>I was born on May 14th and have lived in Charleston, SC my entire life. I attended Buist Academy for Advanced studies for my elementary and middle school years. I later attended James Island Charter Highschool and graduated in May 2020. In august I would then attend the University of South Carolina-Columbia and have my Freshman year there. I later transferred to the College of Charleston and am currently finishing my remaining years of college. I expect to graduate in May 2024.</p>

    <p>Charleston South Carolina is the oldest and largest city in South Carolina as well as being one of the most popular. Founded in 1670, Charleston remains as a historical flashback to the past with it's preserved historic Architecture, roads and sites. Besides the already historic and preserved architecture, charleston houses numerous natural sites and the area has many native and non-native flora that enhance the overall environment and makes Charleston both a historic as well as natural coastal site.</p>

    <h1 id="Hobbies">Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Besides photography, my hobbies include cooking, baking, reading, video games, playing chess as well as web-design. I've come to really enjoy baking in my spare time, baking cakes, breads, pastries and treats. All of my hobbies I've practiced for many years, dating furthest back to 2007 when I first started to really get interested in gaming and reading.</p>

    <h1 id="Academics">Academics</h1>
    <p>During my elementary to highschool years, I was in the IB or international baccleariate program which taught openmindedness and academic success. These tennents have stayed with my throughout my academic career and have kept me going into achieving what I want with programs I wish to pursue. When I first began my college education at the University of South Carolina I was a computer Science major and even when transferring to the College of Charleston I stayed as a computer science major until the 2nd semester of my sophomore year. There I would switch to being a CITA major or Computing in the Arts with a digital media concentration. During my time in College of Charleston I have maintained a 3.7 GPA and have even made the president's list. I plan on continueing my academic success fully until I graduate.</p>

    <h1 id="Goals">Goals</h1>
    <p>My goals are to graduate by my expected date of May 2024 with a bachelors in CITA and to hopefully leave my hometown and get into a entrance level position in web design or UI design or any design field related to computers. I feel my choice in major allows for flexibility. I eventually plan on starting my own company related to web-design and would hopefully be able to tie-in my like of photography as well. I also plan on maybe opening my own bakery or at least selling my baked goods from time to time as well.</p>

    <h2>Why I started photography</h2>
    <p>I've always been interested in nature and the environment ever since I was a young boy. Collecting rocks, watching natural geographic, reading numerous books of the natural world. For the longest time I've felt very enraptured in it. Furthermore two photographers in my life that are the parents of a close friend of mine also sowed the seeds to one of my favorite hobbies. However I started to really enjoy photography exactly in 2022, using a loaned camera by a friend. I went around the peninsula taking pictures of flora I felt they would like in an effort to impress them. However as I traveled around the peninsula, I later found to really enjoy the habit of walking around, sightseeing and taking pictures of things I found pleasing to the eye even after me and this friend eventually drifted aprart. I would later recieve my own camera from my mother as a christmas gift and ever since then I've gone around and taken my own photos typically centered around flowers, nature, animals and architecture.</p>
